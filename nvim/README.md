## Suggested Improvements

Here are some suggestions for improving your Neovim experience:

### Plugins

* **[telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)**: A highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. It's great for finding files, buffers, and more.
* **[nvim-tree.lua](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua)**: A file explorer tree.
* **[gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)**: Git decorations. It shows you which lines have been added, modified, or deleted.
* **[nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp)**: A completion engine for Neovim. It's modular and extensible.

### Configuration

* **Custom keymaps**: You can add your own keymaps to `lua/config/keymaps.lua` to speed up your workflow.
* **Custom snippets**: You can add your own snippets to the `friendly-snippets` plugin to make it easier to write common code.

## Future Improvements

* **[DAP](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap)**: Add debug adapter protocol support for a better debugging experience.
* **[Linters](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint)**: Add linters for the languages you use to catch errors before you run your code.
* **[Formatters](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim)**: Add formatters to automatically format your code on save.
