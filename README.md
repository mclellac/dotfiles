### Installation
The install script is very much tailored for myself. However, you're free to use it if you want to, modify it if you need to, or anything else.

It will not make any backups of your current configuration, and it doesn't allow any argument passing to install specific portions (previously it did, but I found it annoying)

```bash
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mclellac/dotfiles/master/install.sh -L)
```
