## Installation
  The install script is very much tailored for myself. However, you are free to use, and change it in whatever way your heart desires.

  It will not make any backups of your current configuration, and it doesn't allow any argument passing to install specific portions.

### How to install
  Paste this into your terminal, press enter, and it should take care of the rest.

```bash
$ ./setup.py
```
